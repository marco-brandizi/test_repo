# Some tricks and tips about git

## How to develop a new chunk from the main branch

* **Always, always update your clone as first step**. You don't want to make a change on code that is days, weeks, months old!
* Work locally, commit locally in a consistent way: every commit should be about one particular aspect that the commited changes are about, or at least about a small set of related changes. For example:
  * bugfix about orders not saved when product description is empty (#issueNumber)
  * introducing gene search
  * completing gene search with sequence matching
* Ideally, commit when your application builds, including that it passes the automatic tests. Although that's not as important as when you push
* When ready, push your local commits back to the main repo (eg, on github)
  * **do git pull before pushing**. If you know much might have changed, use the alignment procedure shown below, based on fetch/pull. Remember to **test again** after a merge between remote and local changes. Only do the actual push when your code is in a state of minimal working condition, ie, it builds, including automated tests.
    * Leave some comment or alike if you know some feature is still not working/incomplete. 

### How to align with your main branch

After I've made a few changes on your local clone, I usually align with the main repo (eg, on github) this way:

* If I'm sure the main repo hasn't changed or hasn't changed significantly since my last local update (via pull or alike), I do a git pull.
* Else, if I know I might have significant differences coming from the main repo, I do a git fetch, and then I compare the local version with the one marked with the branch `origin/*` (eg, `origin/main`). I recommend a visual tool to perform such comparison (eg, Eclipse Egit, SmartGit, Megit). I usually use Egit or Megit, which allows me to compare files one-by-one and to merge remote changes onto local files, or even do manual edits.
  * Once I'm happy with the alignment changes I've made this way on my local copy (ie, everything builds and passes the tests), I do a merge in 'hard ours' mode (see below) and finally, I commit and push such local changes.

## How I work on feature branches

General note: I usually work with small teams, We usually use a kind of [feature branch-based git workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), that is, we normally commit/push on the main branch (we push when things are minimally working, see above) and we open feature branches for creating a new feature that will require some time before being ready for merging in the main code. Similarly, we open a branch for anything that is likely to break the main code (including deployments) for several days or longer. See [here](https://medium.com/@patrickporto/4-branching-workflows-for-git-30d0aaee7bf) for a summary about main git workflows.

For instance, when I create a new feature that I think requires a branch I do:

* **First I update my local clone** with git pull or fetch+pull (see above)
* I open a branch, naming it YYYYMMDD-feature-summary or YYYMM-feature-summary (depending on how long time I expect to work on it). The date (in that format) is important to see output from 'git branch' or 'git tag' in chronological order (and to not mess up with: when did I start that?).
* I work on the new branch for a while, filing one or more commits
* From time to time, I pull the main branch and align the feature branch with the code in main (in a way similar to 'How to align with your main branch' above).
* From time to time, I push my feature branch, mainly to let others check what I'm doing. It's not strictly necessary to push versions that work, but can be useful (especially if the continuous integration system tries to build all branches)
* When I'm ready to align to main (ie, I did updates and alignment, everything works in the branch), I merge from the feature branch to main, using 'hard theirs' mode (see below). Eventually, I push everything upstream.
  * Beware of the impact that your new feature has on CI-deployed systems, eg, has the config format changed?
* After a while, when the feature is embedded in the code, I 'close' the branch (see below), leaving a tag for possible reopening.

## Creating a branch from local changes

```bash
git switch -c <new-branch>
```


## Downloading a branch

```bash
git checkout -b experimental origin/experimental
```

[Reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-do-i-clone-all-remote-branches-with-git)

Might not work, when the branch is recent, so do this before:

```bash
git remote update
git fetch
```

## Creating a repo from an existing directory

```bash
git init
```

Then create it on github and it will tell you how to link the two (git remote).


## github forks

[Reference](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)


## Push a branch upstream

```bash
git push -u origin branch
```

Name the branch you want to send up, else it will take master, even if you’re on a different branch.

[Reference](http://www.mariopareja.com/blog/archive/2010/01/11/how-to-push-a-new-local-branch-to-a-remote.aspx)

  * [how to setup an upstream branch](https://devconnected.com/how-to-set-upstream-branch-on-git/)
  * [upstream tracking](https://mincong.io/2018/05/02/git-upstream-tracking/)

## Updating from upstream (aka pull from upstream)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

Which is more the fine-grained version of `git pull upstream`


## Changing the remote pointer

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo2.git
git remote -v # will show you the results
```

## Pulling a new branch

```bash
git fetch
git checkout <branch>
```


## Tags
  
[Reference](http://learn.github.com/p/tagging.html)

* List tags: `git tag`
* Add a tag: `git tag -a 'v1.3.1' -m 'Version 1.3.1'`
* Push all, tags included (not done by default): `git push --tags`

* Delete a tag on the remote repository
  * First delete it from the local repository: `git tag --delete xxx`
  * then issue: `git push --force origin :refs/tags/xxx`
 
* Checkout a given tag: `checkout tags/<tag_name>`


## Merge with "hard ours"

```bash
git merge --no-ff -s ours dev-branch
```
  
This is different than `-X ours`, cause it doesn't look at all at dev, and takes our version only.


## Merge with "hard theirs"

The option `git -s recursive -Xtheirs` isn't enough, you need the following ([reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/bqx85v/how_do_i_overwrite_one_branch_with_another_branch/)

```bash
git checkout <branch to reset>
git reset --hard <branch to bring into this one>
```
  
At this point, it's likely you also need to pull without cancelling the above again (if you're rolling back changes coming from remote/upstream):

```bash
git merge -s ours origin/<branch to reset>
```

Now, push, and remember you'll lose the (remote) commits that changed the branch


## Closing a branch

There isn’t no such thing, but it can be simulated via conversion to tag.
[Reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10242924/how-to-close-a-branch-without-removing-it-from-history-in-git)

```bash
git tag archive/<branchname> <branchname>
git branch -d <branchname>
git push origin --delete <branchname> # Propagate upstream
git push --tags # pushes archive/*
```

I've put the commands above in [this script](git-utils/archive-label.sh)

The branch will be deleted, and can be retrieved later by checking out the tag, and recreating the branch:

```bash
git checkout archive/<branchname>
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

## Deleting a tag or branch locally, after remote deletion

Just do this for removing local branches that were deleted remotely: 

```bash
git fetch --prune
# 'git remote' has alternatives
```

## Amending a Commit

```bash
git commit --amend
```

and then edit the old message. If the commit is already pushed, do `git push --force [branch]`

If you need to amend an old (before the latest) message, use [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message). If it's already pushed, do `git push --force` at the end, as they suggest. 

In both cases, you're rewriting the commit history when you push, so be careful and tell the collaborators.
